## API

### gitifyTransform(file)

The resulting html has the following transformations:
  - all code sample links are redirected point to gihub repo blob
  - wrap in div.jsdoc-githubify for styling

#### Note:

The github blob url is derived from the remote of the github repository in the current directory
and the currently checked out branch is used. You can override these with the following environment vars:

- `JSDOC_GITHUBIFY_REMOTE`
- `JSDOC_GITHUBIFY_BRANCH`
